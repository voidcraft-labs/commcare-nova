/**
 * OAuth-issued JWT auth path for the MCP route.
 *
 * Sibling to `api-key-auth.ts`. The plugin endpoint in `auth-plugin.ts`
 * peeks the bearer prefix and dispatches here for any bearer that does
 * NOT start with `NOVA_API_KEY_PREFIX`. Both paths converge on
 * `dispatchMcpTools` so downstream tools see one `ToolContext`.
 *
 * `mcpHandler` from `@better-auth/oauth-provider` does the heavy
 * lifting: pulls the bearer off the request, verifies it against the
 * AS's JWKS, and returns its own `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
 * resource_metadata="…"` 401 on missing or invalid tokens so Claude
 * Code can auto-discover the AS and start the OAuth flow.
 *
 * After verify succeeds, the inner callback enforces structural
 * claim presence (`sub`, `azp`, `iat`) and runs the per-grant
 * revocation lock (`hasActiveConsent`) before building the
 * `ToolContext` and dispatching tools. The revocation lock exists
 * because access-token verification is self-contained — without it,
 * a token whose grant was revoked from `/settings` would keep
 * authenticating until the token expires.
