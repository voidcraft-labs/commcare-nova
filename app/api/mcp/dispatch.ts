/**
 * Shared MCP tool dispatch — both auth paths (JWT and API-key) hand
 * a verified caller context here. Lifted out of `route.ts` into its
 * own module so `route.ts`, `api-key-auth.ts`, and `jwt-auth.ts` can
 * all import it without forming an import cycle.
 *
 * `mcp-handler` matches `new URL(req.url).pathname` against its
 * computed `${basePath}/mcp` endpoint. The route shim in `route.ts`
 * synthesizes a new Request with URL `/api/auth/mcp` before handing
 * it to Better Auth's `auth.handler`, so by the time the request
 * reaches `dispatchMcpTools` the pathname is always `/api/auth/mcp`
 * — independent of wire path. Hence `basePath: "/api/auth"` here is
 * a stable literal; no more dev-vs-prod branching on
 * `MCP_RESOURCE_PATH`.
 *
 * Fresh `McpServer` per request. Binding tools on every call is cheap
 * (register* helpers just call `server.registerTool`) and the
 * alternative — a long-lived server — would leak the first caller's
 * identity into every subsequent request.
