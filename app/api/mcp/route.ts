/**
 * Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint for Nova.
 *
 * ## External URL vs internal path
 *
 * External callers (Claude Code and other MCP clients) talk to
 * `https://mcp.commcare.app/mcp`. Internally, Next.js File-system
 * routing puts this handler at `app/api/mcp/route.ts`, so its canonical
 * pathname is `/api/mcp`. The `/mcp` → `/api/mcp` rewrite lives in
 * `proxy.ts` on the MCP host (see the host allowlist in
 * `lib/hostnames.ts`): the external URL stays clean, the internal
 * layout follows Next.js convention.
 *
 * `mcp-handler`'s default `basePath: "/api"` composes with the `/mcp`
 * segment to produce the exact pathname it expects to match against
 * internally. Keeping `basePath: "/api"` explicit here is belt-and-
 * suspenders in case a library version changes the default.
 *
 * ## Request flow
 *
 *   1. `mcpHandler` verifies the bearer against the local JWKS at
 *      `https://commcare.app/api/auth/jwks`, validates `iss` + `aud`
 *      against the values declared below, and enforces that the token
 *      carries ALL scopes listed in the outer `scopes` array (the
 *      helper's semantics are "must include all, extras allowed" —
 *      confirmed in `@better-auth/core/dist/oauth2/verify.d.mts`).
 *      Missing/invalid token → 401 with a `WWW-Authenticate` header
 *      pointing at the authorization server so Claude Code can
 *      auto-discover and start the OAuth flow. Missing required scope
 *      → 403.
 *   2. On success, `mcpHandler` hands the verified `JWTPayload` to the
 *      inner handler. We narrow it to our `JwtClaims` shape (see
 *      `lib/mcp/types.ts`), confirm the user still has an active
 *      `oauthConsent` for the calling client (the instant-revocation
 *      lock — see "Why the consent check" below), and instantiate a
 *      per-request `createMcpHandler` that registers every Nova tool
 *      on a fresh `McpServer`.
 *   3. The MCP JSON-RPC layer inside `createMcpHandler` dispatches the
 *      tool call through the registered callback.
 *
 * ## Two-layer scope enforcement
 *
 * Scope checks split between this verify layer and the individual tool
 * handlers, picked by whether the scope is *comparable* (read vs
 * write — one is a subset of the other in capability) or *orthogonal*
 * to read/write (HQ access — a separate authorization to a third-party
 * system that cuts across both axes).
 *
 *   - **Comparable, verify-layer.** `nova.read` and `nova.write` are
 *     declared in `verifyAccessToken({ scopes })` below. Every tool
 *     registered downstream inherits the check for free — there is no
 *     per-handler `requireScope(...)` call to forget, and a newly added
 *     Nova-internal tool can't ship without enforcement.
 *   - **Orthogonal, per-tool.** `nova.hq.read` and `nova.hq.write` gate
 *     access to CommCare HQ. They're not comparable to read/write
 *     (you can have HQ access without Nova write, or vice versa), so
 *     mount-splitting can't capture them — it would require a 4-way
 *     mount cross-product. Instead, HQ tools call `requireScope` (in
 *     `lib/mcp/scopes.ts`) at the top of their handler. Adding HQ
 *     scopes to *this* layer's `scopes` array would mandate them for
 *     every MCP request, defeating the orthogonal split.
 *
 * ## Why the JWT narrowing runs here
 *
 * `JWTPayload` from `jose` is intentionally loose — `sub` is
 * `string | undefined`, `aud` is `string | string[] | undefined`, and
 * every other claim is typed `unknown`. The Nova tools downstream want
 * a concrete `JwtClaims` with `sub: string` guaranteed. The verify
 * layer has already checked the token signature + aud + iss, so a
 * missing `sub` at this point means the token is structurally broken;
 * we throw rather than silently coerce.
 *
 * ## Why the consent check runs every request
 *
 * JWT access tokens are self-contained — the MCP route never calls
 * back to the AS to re-validate, so on its own, signature verification
 * has no way to honor a revoke that happened after the token was
 * minted. The per-request `oauthConsent` lookup IS the revocation
 * lock: deleting the consent from `/settings` makes the next MCP
 * request fail immediately, regardless of token expiry.
