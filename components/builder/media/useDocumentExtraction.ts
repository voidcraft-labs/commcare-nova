// components/builder/media/useDocumentExtraction.ts
//
// Drives the feature-extraction lifecycle for ONE asset, so the file-manager +
// composer can show whether Nova has read a document yet. Extraction
// runs server-side (POST /api/media/[id]/extract); this kicks it off when a
// document has no current extract and tracks the resulting status.
//
// Non-documents (images / audio / video) have no extract — the hook reports
// `null` and does nothing for them. A `ready` document is left alone (already
// read). Anything else (never extracted, a prior failure, a stale version) is
// (re)triggered once on mount; `retry` re-runs a failed one on demand.
