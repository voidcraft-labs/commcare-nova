/**
 * ⚠️  WRITES — convert stored expression slots to the AST
 * representation: every app blueprint's XPath slots string → expression
 * AST, close-condition refs id → uuid, and every event-log mutation
 * payload to the same shapes (so replay reads already-migrated events
 * through the current reducers — no replay shim, no legacy reducers).
 *
 * Conversion is ROUND-TRIP-GATED per expression by the shared core
 * (`migrateDocExpressions` / `migrateMutationExpressions`): a string
 * converts only when printing its parsed AST reproduces the stored
 * bytes exactly; anything else is REPORTED and left as-is. Event
 * payloads convert against the doc reduced forward from the app's own
 * stream, so each reference resolves with the namespace it had when
 * the mutation originally ran — and an event is WRITTEN only after the
 * reducer advanced the doc through it. If a reducer throws (reducers
 * are total, so this should be unreachable), the app's event
 * conversion ABORTS at that event — converting past a doc that stopped
 * advancing could resolve references against a stale namespace, and
 * the round-trip gate can't see that (it prints against the same stale
 * doc). Other apps continue; the run exits non-zero. Event identity
 * and ordering are untouched — only the `mutation` payload field
 * changes.
 *
 * Dry run by default — pass `--apply` to write.
 * `scan-expression-asts.ts` is the read-only twin. Idempotent:
 * a converted slot reads as already-current on a re-run.
 *
 * The blueprint write goes through the app writers' own snapshot-field
 * shape (`lib/db/apps.ts::blueprintSnapshotFields` — denormalized
 * summary + `updated_at` + a ROTATED `blueprint_token`), so a builder
 * tab still open across the migration window gets a stale-basis
 * rejection on its next auto-save and reloads, instead of blind-PUTting
 * its pre-AST doc back over the converted row (which the deployed
 * code's strict load gate would then refuse).
 *
 * One-time migration: the deployed code reads ONLY the AST shape, so
 * the owner runs this against production when deploying the
 * expression-AST representation over data written before it — scan
 * first, then dry run, then `--apply`.
 *
 * Run with `--help` for flags.
