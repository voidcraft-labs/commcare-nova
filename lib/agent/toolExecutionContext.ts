/**
 * Narrow context interface shared between the two surfaces that execute
 * SA tools:
 *
 *   - GenerationContext (lib/agent/generationContext.ts) — chat surface,
 *     implements this via its existing methods.
 *   - McpContext (lib/mcp/context.ts) — MCP surface, implements this by
 *     declaration.
 *
 * The interface is deliberately small. It exposes only what tool bodies
 * legitimately need to perform their domain work. Anything surface-
 * specific (spend cap, web UI state sync, SSE writer, progress token,
 * prompt cache) stays on the concrete class and never leaks into shared
 * tool logic.
 *
 * Tool modules in lib/agent/tools/<name>.ts take `ctx: ToolExecutionContext`
 * in their execute signature, never the concrete GenerationContext or
 * McpContext. The concrete class is chosen by the caller (chat route vs
 * MCP adapter).
