// lib/agent/__tests__/fixtures.ts
//
// Shared test fixtures for the agent layer. `makeTestContext` builds a
// `GenerationContext` wired to vi.fn stubs on its two write surfaces —
// the SSE writer and the event-log writer — plus a real
// `UsageAccumulator` seeded with deterministic values. Every agent test
// that touches emission, usage tracking, or conversation events should
// use this helper so the construction shape stays in sync with the
// production constructor.
//
// `makeMcpTestContext` is the sibling for the MCP surface: a stubbed
// `McpContext` so shared tool modules can be driven through both
// surfaces in cross-surface tests, exercising the same
// `ToolExecutionContext` interface the production adapter uses.
//
// The helpers return both the `ctx` (for driving calls into the class
// under test) and the stubs (for asserting what the class wrote). All
// stubs are typed loosely — `vi.fn()` erases the production signature,
// and tests that care about argument shapes assert on
// `mock.calls[i][j]` explicitly.
