 * Server-side `run_id` derivation.

 * The MCP wire surface does not carry `run_id` — clients never supply
 * one and never see one. The server infers a grouping id from state it
 * already observes (the app's `run_id` field + `updated_at` timestamp)
 * so admin surfaces can stitch related event-log rows together without
 * trusting or validating client-supplied ids.
 *
 * Sliding-window semantics: as long as mutations keep landing on an app
 * within `WINDOW_MS`, they all share the app's current `run_id`. After
 * `WINDOW_MS` of inactivity, the next mutation mints a fresh id and the
 * old run is "closed" in the event log.
 *
 * Pure function — the caller extracts primitives from the Firestore
 * `AppDoc` and passes them in. Keeping the signature free of Firestore
 * types makes this trivially unit-testable and decouples the derivation
 * logic from the `Timestamp` wire type.
