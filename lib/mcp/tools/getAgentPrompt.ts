/**
 * `nova.get_agent_prompt` — self-fetch bootstrap tool.
 *
 * Scope: `nova.read` (enforced at the verify layer — the route handler
 * declares this tool's mount with `scopes: ["nova.read"]` so by the time
 * this body runs the JWT already proved the scope; no per-handler check).
 *
 * The plugin ships two static subagent files whose bodies instruct the
 * spawned subagent to call this tool on turn 0 and treat the returned
 * text as its full operating instructions. Hosting the renderer server-
 * side is what lets us iterate the SA's prompt body without a plugin
 * release — every subagent spawn fetches fresh.
 *
 * **Edit mode loads the blueprint here.** When `mode === "edit"`, the
 * tool requires `app_id`, ownership-gates on it, loads the blueprint,
 * and passes the doc through to `renderAgentPrompt` so the spawned
 * subagent boots with `EDIT_PREAMBLE` framing + an inlined
 * `summarizeBlueprint(doc)` — exact parity with the web flow's edit
 * mode (`/api/chat`). Without this round trip the edit subagent would
 * have to spend its first tool call re-fetching what the server already
 * has on hand.
 *
 * Build mode (`mode === "build"`) ignores `app_id` even when present.
 * Skill simplicity wins here: `mode` is the authoritative flag, and a
 * spurious id shouldn't cause a Firestore round-trip or skew the
 * envelope. `_meta.app_id` is therefore only stamped on edit-mode
 * success — a build response with `_meta.app_id` would mislead admin
 * surfaces correlating runs to apps.
 *
 * **Plain text, not JSON.** The handler emits the rendered system
 * prompt as a plain MCP `text` content block. The plugin's bootstrap
 * subagent reads that text verbatim as its operating instructions — no
 * JSON wrapper, no parse step on the hot path.
 *
 * **`_meta.run_id` is still threaded.** Same reason `list_apps` does
 * it: MCP clients bundle multi-call runs under one id so admin surfaces
 * grouping by run id can stitch this call to the sibling tool calls the
 * plugin skill makes during the same build (e.g.
 * `get_agent_prompt` → `create_app` → `generate_schema`). Without
 * threading it here the bootstrap call would orphan from the rest of
 * the run on every admin timeline.

/**
 * Register the three-argument `get_agent_prompt` tool on an `McpServer`.
 *
 * Inputs:
 *   - `mode` and `interactive` are the two decision flags every call
 *     supplies. `mode` drives whether edit-mode blueprint loading fires
 *     (and implicitly, which system-prompt framing renders).
 *     `interactive` picks the Interaction Mode section appended to the
 *     rendered body.
 *   - `app_id` is conditionally required: required in edit mode (so the
 *     handler can ownership-gate + inline the blueprint summary into
 *     the system prompt), ignored in build mode (skill convenience —
 *     `mode` is the authoritative discriminator). The conditional is
 *     not expressible in raw-shape Zod, so the handler enforces it via
 *     a typed `McpInvalidInputError` throw at the top.
 *
 * `ctx.userId` rides every error envelope so cross-tenant audit logging
 * (in `toMcpErrorResult`'s `McpAccessError` branch) stays uniform across
 * every tool. The build-mode happy path doesn't read `ctx.userId`; edit
 * mode reads it for `requireOwnedApp` to gate the blueprint load.
