/**
 * `sharedToolAdapter` — the single wrapper every shared SA tool goes
 * through to mount on the MCP server.
 *
 * Every module in `lib/agent/tools/<name>.ts` is a self-contained unit
 * of domain logic — it computes + (for writers) persists mutations
 * against a `BlueprintDoc`, then returns a typed result. The shared
 * tool contract standardizes the shape so that both the chat-side
 * `ToolLoopAgent` factory in `lib/agent/solutionsArchitect.ts` and
 * this adapter can consume the same module without duplicating the
 * core behavior.
 *
 * What this adapter adds around each tool call:
 *
 *   1. **Ownership** — `loadAppBlueprint(appId, userId)` ownership-gates
 *      and loads the doc in one Firestore read, so a cross-tenant probe
 *      throws before the tool body runs.
 *   2. **Per-call `McpContext`** — satisfies `ToolExecutionContext` for
 *      the shared tool and owns event-log writer + progress emitter +
 *      run id.
 *   3. **Server-derived run id** — after the app is loaded, the
 *      adapter derives a run id from the app's own state (current
 *      `run_id` + `updated_at` sliding window) and passes it into the
 *      context. Clients never see or supply a run id; see
 *      `lib/mcp/runId.ts` for the derivation semantics.
 *   4. **Progress emitter** — adapters inside the tool body emit
 *      fine-grained stage notifications; the emitter no-ops when the
 *      client didn't opt in.
 *   5. **Log-writer flush** — `finally`-block drain so conversation
 *      events + mutation envelopes always reach Firestore even on
 *      throw. `LogWriter.logEvent` is fire-and-forget and a missed
 *      flush silently drops everything that hadn't hit the batch-size
 *      trigger yet.
 *   6. **Result projection** — three structural shapes (read /
 *      mutating / validateApp) reduce to a single MCP text payload the
 *      LLM can reason over.
 *
 * **Hard invariant — the adapter MUST NOT re-persist mutations.**
 * Every shared mutating tool already calls
 * `ctx.recordMutations(mutations, newDoc, stage)` inside its own body
 * before returning its `MutatingToolResult`. Doing it again here would
 * double-write the blueprint to Firestore AND emit two copies of every
 * mutation event into the log stream. The adapter's job is to delegate
 * + envelope, never to re-apply.
 *
 * **`app_id` splicing.** The MCP tool schema injects an `app_id`
 * argument (the shared tool schemas don't declare it — they take
 * `appId` from `ctx`), so we surface it to the LLM at the tool
 * boundary and strip it before forwarding to the shared tool's
 * `execute`. Leaving it in would either be ignored (tool schemas are
 * narrow) or would fail Zod parsing on stricter tools.

 *     HQ JSON would balloon the response by megabytes for no MCP
 *     benefit: callers re-read state via `get_app` or `compile_app`
