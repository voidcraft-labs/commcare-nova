// Resolves a blueprint's media references into the `AssetManifest` the
// wire emitters (`expandDoc` / `compileCcz`) consume. The one bridge
// from storage (Firestore rows + GCS bytes) to the CommCare wire-path
// vocabulary — which is why this file is the single media-side member
// of the `lib/commcare` import allowlist (see biome.json).
//
// Server-only: it reads Firestore + GCS. The compile / upload routes
// and the MCP compile tool call it; the validation loop and asset-free
// previews skip it (passing no manifest = media emission off).

 *
 * Returns an empty manifest when the doc references no media — the
 * emitters treat an empty manifest the same as media-off, so a
 * media-free app costs one cheap `collectAssetRefs` walk and no I/O.
 *
 * The wire-emission manifest filters out non-`ready` rows here even
 * though `loadAssetsByIds` returns them — a pending row's GCS object
 * is unvalidated bytes, so resolving a `jr://` ref to it would bundle
 * garbage into the CCZ. The validator's `mediaAssetReady` rule fires
 * first in the SA loop with the user-actionable "still uploading"
 * message; the filter here is the lower-layer guard for any caller
 * that reaches emission without the validator (`compileCcz`,
 * `expandDoc` invoked directly from tests).
 *
 * A doc reference whose asset doesn't make it into the manifest
 * (foreign-owned, deleted, or filtered pending here) surfaces at
 * emission as a `requireAssetRef` throw — the floor when the
 * validator path was skipped.
