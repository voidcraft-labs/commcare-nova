/**
 * Better Auth — server-side authentication singleton.
 *
 * Initialized lazily via `getAuth()` so the Firestore adapter and env var
 * reads happen on the first real request, not at import time. This matters
 * because `next build` imports server modules during page collection —
 * module-level initialization would try to connect to Firestore and read
 * secrets that don't exist in the build environment.
 *
 * `auth_users` is the single source of truth for user identity. The app
 * extends it with `lastActiveAt` via `additionalFields` — no separate
 * user collection. Auth state lives in `auth_users`, `auth_sessions`,
 * `auth_accounts`, and `auth_verifications`.
 *
 * Required env vars (at runtime, not build time):
 *   BETTER_AUTH_SECRET   — cookie signing secret (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
 *   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID     — Google OAuth client ID
 *   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET — Google OAuth client secret
 *   BETTER_AUTH_URL      — Base URL (e.g. http://localhost:3000 or production URL).
 *                          Optional in dev — Better Auth auto-detects from requests.

			 * `rateLimit` above) with sensible production defaults. We
			 * override `register` specifically because it's the one public,
			 * unauthenticated endpoint that persists a Firestore doc on
