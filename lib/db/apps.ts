 * The claim is a TRANSACTION because same-app contenders share ONE row —
 * `hasActiveGeneration` excludes the contender's own appId, so the row
 * can't arbitrate between them the way per-contender `createApp` rows
 * arbitrate new builds. The compare-and-flip is the lock: the first
 * contender's transaction sees a claimable shape and flips it; the
 * loser's re-read sees a live `generating` (no pause flag) and throws
 * `BuildRunConflictError` with nothing written, so two near-simultaneous
 * POSTs can never run two SA loops against one app.
 *
 * A non-paused `generating` row reads as owned ONLY while its
 * `updated_at` is inside the staleness window. Past it, the run is dead
 * (a hard kill the list/concurrency reapers haven't scanned yet — and a
 * retry POST runs neither of them, so without this arm the 429 would
 * repeat indefinitely while telling the user to wait for a run that no
 * longer exists). The claim settles the dead run exactly as
 * `reapStaleGenerating` would — refund-first off the marker's `settled`
 * flag, classification `internal` per the reaper's convention — and
 * claims in the same transaction, reporting `from: "error"` because
 * that IS the shape the reaper would have left for a bail-out to
 * restore.
 *
 * The claim also SETTLES the displaced run's reservation marker. Every
 * shape it displaces has already resolved its charge — `complete` kept
 * it, `error` was refunded (refund settles), a paused run kept it (the
 * pause policy), and the stale arm refunds it right here — so the
 * marker must read settled the moment the row flips: between this claim
 * and the new run's `reserveCredits` (which overwrites the marker with
 * its own fresh, unsettled one), a hard kill or a dropped bail-out
 * restore leaves a `generating` row the reaper WILL reap, and an
 * unsettled leftover marker there would hand back a charge that was
 * kept.
 *
 * Returns the shape the claim moved the app out of, for bail-out
 * restoration (see `ClaimedBuildRun`).

 * `refundReservation` is idempotent (the settled marker), so the retry settles

 * the `generating` window before the refund landed and strand the hold forever.
 * A refund failure returns early (no status flip) for the same reason: leave the
 * row reapable so the refund is retried, rather than marking it done with the
 * hold still booked.
 *
 * An app with no marker (created before reservations shipped, or whose run never
 * reserved) reaps to `error` with no refund — `refundReservation` no-ops on the

 * failure self-heals on the next scan.
 *
 * Scope: BUILDS only. The reaper keys on `status: "generating"`, which only the
 * build paths write — `createApp` for a new build, `claimBuildRun` for every
 * chargeable build POST against an existing app (a retry of a failed build, a
 * new instruction into a finished one, a takeover of a paused one). A
 * chargeable EDIT reserves credits but keeps its app `complete`, so a
 * hard-killed edit's 5-credit hold is never reaped — an accepted residual
 * (small and rare). Builds are the high-value case (100 credits) this reaper
 * exists for. `claimBuildRun`'s stale-displacement arm performs this same

 * unnecessary here because data is validated on write (completeApp,
 * updateApp) and defaults are baked in at that time.
 *
 * Soft-deleted rows are filtered at the Firestore query layer via
 * `where("deleted_at", "==", null)`. Filtering in JS after `.limit(N)`
 * is the obvious-looking alternative but lets a deleted-heavy page
 * return short with `next_cursor` still set. Server-side filtering
 * preserves "page returns up to `limit` visible rows; cursor set iff
 * more truly exist."
 *
 * A secondary `orderBy("__name__", "asc")` is appended to every query —
 * it is Firestore's document id, implicitly the tiebreaker — so a
 * cursor built from `(sort_field, id)` resumes deterministically even
 * when two apps share the same sort-field value (common for
 * `updated_at` when writes land in the same tick).
 *
 * Required composite indexes (all scoped to `collectionGroup: "apps"`,
 * `deleted_at` first so the equality filter binds the prefix):
 *   - `(owner ASC, deleted_at ASC, updated_at DESC)` — default sort.
 *   - `(owner ASC, deleted_at ASC, updated_at ASC)` — updated_asc.
 *   - `(owner ASC, deleted_at ASC, app_name_lower ASC)` — name_asc.
 *   - `(owner ASC, deleted_at ASC, app_name_lower DESC)` — name_desc.
 *   - The same four with `status ASC` inserted before the sort field
 *     for status-filtered variants.
 *
 * Pagination semantics: `nextCursor` is present iff Firestore returned
 * exactly `limit` rows. Because the soft-delete filter runs server-
 * side, every returned doc is visible — `apps.length === snap.size` —
 * so the cursor accurately signals "more visible apps may exist."
 *
 * Stale-generating reaper behavior is per-page: only rows scanned by
 * this call get reaped. An app that is stale but lives on a page the

/**
 * Search a user's apps by name with fuzzy matching.

 * Composes on top of `listApps` rather than running its own Firestore
 * query: `listApps` is the single canonical surface that owns soft-
 * delete stripping, stale-`generating` reaping, index usage, and
 * partial-field projection. Mirroring any of that here would be a
 * drift risk. Fuse.js runs over the `listApps` page in memory, ranking
 * results by relevance (edit-distance-based scoring via the Bitap
 * algorithm) — which is also why `searchApps` has no `sort` option:
 * relevance IS the ordering.
 *
 * Pagination semantics: one `listApps` call per `searchApps` call (no
 * internal looping). `searchApps` over-fetches by `SEARCH_FETCH_BUFFER`
 * rows so a typical query produces a full page in one round trip. When
 * Fuse returns fewer than `limit` matches and `listApps` still has
 * more to scan, the underlying `listApps.nextCursor` is passed through —
 * the caller re-calls with it to search the next batch. Total matches
 * across multiple calls are bounded by what the user actually has.
 *
 * The scan uses `sort: "updated_desc"` internally — searching the
 * newest apps first gives the best average-case latency for "find my
 * recent X" queries, which is the dominant search intent. A user who
 * wants to find an old app by name will traverse more pages; they may,
 * because the cursor works.
 *
 * When Nova's per-user app count grows beyond the buffer's reach, this
 * function is the single site to swap the in-memory Fuse filter for a
 * search index (Algolia / Typesense / trigram-denormalized storage).
 * The tool schema + cursor contract on the outside remains the same.

 *      as-implicit-filter trick doesn't apply here: every live row
 *      writes `deleted_at: null` explicitly (see `createApp`), so the
 *      field is present in the index and `orderBy("deleted_at")` would
 *      return live rows too — consuming the page budget on rows that
 *      get stripped in JS.
 *   2. **In-memory "still recoverable":** rows whose `recoverable_until`
 *      has elapsed are filtered out before returning. The trash UI is
 *      a recovery surface, not a permanent archive — past-window
 *      tombstones don't belong there.
 *
 * The `__name__ ASC` tiebreaker resolves two apps deleted in the same
 * millisecond deterministically.
 *
 * Past-window rows persist on disk; this helper filters them out of
 * the trash UI once `recoverable_until` elapses.
 *
 * Status, error_type, and the standard timestamps are surfaced as-is.
 * Soft-delete is the existence axis, not the lifecycle axis — a
 * deleted `error` app keeps its `error` status (and `error_type`) so
 * the trash badge reads the truth. The stale-`generating` reaper from
 * `projectAppSummary` is irrelevant here: a deleted row's `updated_at`
