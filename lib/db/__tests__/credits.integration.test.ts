/**
 * Integration tests for the credit ledger's transactional reservation against
 * a real Firestore emulator. The unit suite (`credits.test.ts`) drives a
 * scripted transaction with spies; this file exercises the genuine
 * runTransaction round-trip, which proves the read-check-write commits and
 * reads back as a complete, correctly-defaulted on-disk document.
 *
 * What this proves that the unit suite can't:
 *   - `reserveCredits` against a real, never-seen user creates
 *     `credits/{userId}/months/{period}` with `consumed` equal to the cost and
 *     a full allowance seeded — the genuine first-write path through Firestore's
 *     `set(..., { merge: true })`, not a spied stand-in.
 *   - A second affordable reservation decrements further; a reservation that
 *     exceeds the remaining balance throws and leaves the on-disk doc
 *     UNCHANGED (the rejected charge books nothing).
 *
 * Why the multi-writer CONCURRENCY race is NOT here: both the server SDK
 * (`@google-cloud/firestore`, what production runs against a Standard-edition
 * database) and the emulator take read locks on a transactional read — they are
 * pessimistic, not optimistic compare-and-set. The difference is what each does
 * when two single-doc transactions contend. Production cleanly ABORTs one ("Too
 * much contention") and the SDK retries it; the retry re-reads the depleted
 * balance and rejects. The EMULATOR's `ReactiveLockManager` instead LIVELOCKS
 * the pair — each holds a read lock while awaiting the other's write lock — and
 * churns "Transaction lock timeout → ABORTED → SDK retry" for ~30s rather than
 * resolving to one winner and one rejection (confirmed in `firestore-debug.log`
 * and by a 30s test timeout). The emulator cannot model the clean abort-and-retry
 * the race was meant to assert. That contention path — the aborted loser is
 * retried and its re-read rejects — is instead exercised deterministically
 * against the REAL `reserveCredits` closure in `credits.test.ts` ("rejects on a
 * transaction retry whose re-read shows the balance newly depleted"), which
 * re-runs the closure with the depleted snapshot the SDK's retry would observe.
 *
 * Auto-skipped when `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST` is unset — run via
 * `npm run test:integration`, which boots the emulator and exports the host.

/**
 * Integration round-trips for the refund and admin reset/grant writers, plus the

 *
 *   - reset and grant land BOTH documents — the month-doc mutation AND the
 *     append-only audit row — in ONE committed transaction: the two `tx.set`
 *     calls share a single `runTransaction` closure, so reading both back after
 *     a successful commit proves they were written together as one unit. (This
 *     is the committed-together property, not a both-or-neither rollback claim —
 *     no failure is injected mid-transaction here.) The unit suite only proves
 *     both `tx.set` calls FIRE; it can't observe a real commit.
 *   - `resetCredits` and `grantCredits` on a user with NO current-period doc
 *     write a doc the REAL Zod converter reads back without throwing — the
 *     central hazard guard. A reset seeds a COMPLETE doc (explicit allowance,
 *     consumed 0); a grant omits `consumed` (it must never erase usage), so its
 *     doc-less write relies on `creditMonthDocSchema.consumed`'s `.default(0)` to
 *     fill the gap on read. `allowance` has no Zod default on either path, so
 *     only a real converter read over a real on-disk doc proves the seed parses.
 *     A spied read can't.
 *   - `refundCredits` actually decrements `consumed` on disk and a re-read
 *     reflects it.
 *
 * The production `getDb()` inside the writers/summary connects to the same
 * emulator as our `db` client via `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST`.
