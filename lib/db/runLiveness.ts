 * The SINGLE reader for run liveness / ownership / paused / settled state.

 * reapers, the terminal WRITERS (`completeAndSettleRun` / `clearRunLockAndSettle` /
 * `settleAndRelease` / `failApp` / the flush `refundReservation`, which re-check
 * ownership IN THEIR TXN before mutating), the exact-holder pause/prelude writers
 * (`setAwaitingInput` / `clearRunLock`), the concurrency gate — derives from
 * {@link runLeaseState}. NO other module reads `run_lock.expireAt`,
 * `run_lock.runId`, or `reservation.runId` for a decision (a build-time grep guard
 * fails on a raw read of those three PURE fields outside this file; see
 * `runLivenessGrepGuard.test.ts`). `reservation.settled` is read only by the
 * atomic writers' settle-WRITES (not hard-guarded), and `status` / `awaiting_input`
 * have legitimate non-liveness readers (the UI, status transitions, the build page),
 * so those are NOT hard-guarded — but the credit/claim decision modules route their
 * liveness/paused reads of them through here too.
 *
 * The single-reader invariant is the structural fix for a read-layer divergence
 * class: "is this run alive / mine / paused / owed-a-settle" was computed
 * INDEPENDENTLY at ~10 sites reading different field subsets, so they diverged. Its
 * symmetric WRITE side: a terminal writer RE-CHECKS ownership in its transaction and
 * NO-OPs when a different run owns the app (the reaper-race — a stale run reaped +
 * the freed app re-claimed). A new path physically cannot diverge — no raw field to
 * read — so it consumes the same derived booleans everyone else does.
