/**
 * Shared `domhandler` element + text constructors and serializer options used
 * by every wire-emission module in this package — the XForm side
 * (`xform/builder.ts`, `xform/metaBlock.ts`, `xform/caseBlocks.ts`) and the
 * suite.xml side (`compiler.ts`, `session.ts`, the modules under `suite/`).
 *
 * Each emitter constructs a tree of `Element` / `Text` nodes and hands them to
 * `dom-serializer` once at the end. The serializer is the single, exclusive
 * escaping authority — hand-escaping a value here and then handing it to the
 * serializer would double-encode it (`&` → `&amp;` → `&amp;amp;`). Attribute
 * values are therefore passed in RAW; the serializer XML-escapes `<` / `>` /
 * `&` / `"` / `'` exactly once at render time.
 *
 * Centralizing these helpers keeps the per-emitter modules from re-declaring
 * the same one-line constructors, and pins one set of render options so every
 * emitter's bytes round-trip identically under the validator's parse oracles
 * (`validator/xformOracle.ts` and `validator/suiteOracle.ts` re-parse what
 * these emitters produce).

 * `xmlMode: true` is the load-bearing flag — it routes element names /
 * namespaces / self-closing through XML rules AND switches the
 * attribute-value + text encoder to `encodeXML`. `encodeXML` rewrites
 * `<` / `>` / `&` / `"` / `'` to their named entities (`&lt;` / `&gt;` /
 * `&amp;` / `&quot;` / `&apos;`) and every non-ASCII code point
 * (`\x80-￿`) to a numeric character reference (`&#xNNNN;`). `$` is NOT a
 * special XML character, so it serializes literally — matching CCHQ's
 * own suite.xml, whose Python serializer emits a bare `$` too. (The
 * `entities` library encoded `$` as `&#x24;` through v7; v8 — which
 * htmlparser2 12 / dom-serializer 3 pull in — dropped that over-
 * encoding. Both forms are XML-spec-equivalent: a conforming parser
 * (CCHQ uses Java's standard `DocumentBuilder`) decodes them back
 * identically before the XPath / suite-parse layers see the value.)
 *
 * `selfClosingTags: true` is the xmlMode default but is stated
 * explicitly for clarity. `encodeEntities: "utf8"` is set defensively
 * — in xmlMode the option is inert (encodeXML wins) but it documents
 * the intent and would constrain HTML-mode behavior if a future caller
 * flipped xmlMode off.
