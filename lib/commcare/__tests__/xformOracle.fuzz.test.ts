/**
 * Property-based fuzzer that proves the XForm emitter TOTAL: for every doc the
 * generator produces, every emitted XForm passes the oracle clean — both off
 * the raw `expandDoc` output AND off the `compileCcz` output (after the
 * compiler splices `<case>`/`<subcase>` blocks in, the second oracle call site).
 *
 * The oracle (`validateXForm`) and this fuzzer are co-developed — the oracle is
 * defined by its fuzzer role. A failing case is one of two things, never a new
 * reject rule:
 *   (A) the oracle is too strict (Core would accept the form) → fix the ORACLE;
 *   (B) the emitter produced output Core rejects → fix the EMITTER at source.
 *
 * The generator (`blueprintDocArbitrary`) builds docs valid BY CONSTRUCTION,
 * but each property body re-asserts `runValidation(doc, LOOKUP_CONTEXT_UNAVAILABLE).length === 0` first:
 * the totality claim is scoped to schema-valid docs, so a generator slip must
 * fail loud as a generator bug rather than silently feed an invalid doc to the
 * emitter.
 *
 * **Coverage scope (honest).** The generator exercises FIELD / FORM / REPEAT
 * structure: all field kinds, all four form types, all three repeat modes
 * (incl. query_bound model-iteration), nested groups + repeats, same-id COUSIN
 * fields (different parents sharing an `id` — the case the path + itext
 * arithmetic must disambiguate), selects with duplicate option values, the
 * relevant/required/constraint/calculate/default_value/hint XPath surfaces, and
 * case-bearing forms (so case-block injection runs in the compileCcz pass). It
 * also generates CommCare Connect apps (learn + deliver, every sub-config
 * shape), so `buildConnectBlocks`'s data + bind emission is exercised here too.
 * It does NOT yet generate module-level `caseSearchConfig`, `form_links`, or
 * multi-language itext — those are suite-emission / app-shape surfaces outside
 * the XForm parse-time oracle's scope, and out of scope for this fuzzer until
 * those oracles exist.
 *
 * Seeded for reproducibility; 500 runs to be meaningful without ballooning CI.
