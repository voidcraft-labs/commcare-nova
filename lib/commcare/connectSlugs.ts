/**
 * Connect id validity, creation-time autofill, and the wire-emit resolver.
 *
 * Each per-form `connect` block carries an id (`learn_module.id`,
 * `assessment.id`, `deliver_unit.id`, `task.id`). The XForm builder emits
 * that id three ways for each block: the wrapper element name, the
 * Connect-namespaced `id=` attribute, and every `<bind nodeset="/data/<id>/…">`.
 * CommCare Connect then ingests the id at opportunity-init and writes it
 * into a DB slug column — the tightest, `LearnModule.slug` / `Task.slug`,
 * is a Django `SlugField()` = Postgres `varchar(50)` (`DeliverUnit.slug` is
 * wider at 100). Connect's insert bypasses field validation, so an
 * over-length id reaches Postgres raw and 500s; and the id must be a legal
 * XML element name or the form is malformed.
 *
 * So a connect id has three constraints — legal element name, ≤50 chars,
 * unique across the app — and they are all forced correct at the SOURCE,
 * never fixed up at emit. The same flat app-wide notion of "taken" (every
 * connect id on every form, regardless of kind) is used on every surface:
 *  - {@link connectIdError} is the format/length verdict, shared by the UI
 *    commit guard (`InlineField` in `LearnConfig`) and the `validate_app`
 *    format/length rules so they can't disagree.
 *  - {@link connectIdConflictError} is the contextual uniqueness verdict for
 *    an explicit set (rejected, never silently renamed). The UI guards
 *    (`LearnConfig`/`DeliverConfig`, via `useAppConnectIds`), the SA tools
 *    (`enforceConnectIds`), and the `CONNECT_ID_DUPLICATE` `validate_app`
 *    rule all check it against the app-wide id set.
 *  - {@link deriveConnectId} is the creation-time autofill: an id-less block
 *    gets a valid, unique, name-derived id STORED in the doc.
 *  - {@link buildConnectSlugMap} is the emit-time resolver — a typed
 *    pass-through that asserts each block's id is present + valid and that no
 *    two blocks collide, then narrows the type. It does NOT cap, dedup, or
 *    fall back; the stored id IS the wire slug. It throws (fail-loud) if a
 *    missing, invalid, or duplicate id reaches it, and processes only blocks
 *    matching the doc's `connectType` (so a stray cross-mode block neither
 *    ships nor trips the invariant). The validator reads `form.connect`
 *    directly rather than through this resolver, because it runs on
 *    in-progress docs that may not yet have ids filled.

 * the save and shows the reason inline, and the `validate_app` connect-id
 * rules wrap the same reason in a form-scoped error for the agent path
 * (`update_form`, which sets ids as a bare string and bypasses the field).
