/**
 * BuilderFormEngineProvider — scoped context for the preview EngineController.
 *
 * The EngineController is a plain class that owns the form preview's
 * runtime store (computed visibility, validation, test-mode values) and
 * the blueprint subscriptions that keep it in sync with the doc store.
 * Its lifecycle matches the builder session, not any specific component —
 * so it lives in a context at the provider-stack level rather than in a
 * per-component hook.
 *
 * This provider replaces the `engineController` field that used to live
 * on `BuilderEngine`. Consumers now read it via `useBuilderFormEngine()`
 * instead of `useBuilderEngine().engineController`.
 *
 * Install timing matters: the doc store reference is bound on the
 * controller SYNCHRONOUSLY inside `useState`'s initializer, not in a
 * mount effect. React runs effects child-before-parent, so if the parent
 * (this provider) installed the doc store in `useEffect`, descendant
 * effects that call `controller.activateForm(...)` on first mount would
 * see `docStore === null`, silently no-op, and leave the form preview
 * with no runtime state. Binding inside `useState` avoids that race —
 * by the time any descendant renders, the controller is already wired.
 *
 * A follow-up `useEffect` keeps the binding fresh if the doc store
 * reference changes after mount (rare today since `buildId` changes
 * remount the entire provider tree, but defensive against future
 * refactors) and runs `deactivate()` cleanup on unmount.
